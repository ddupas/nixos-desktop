# fleeting thoughts
Link stew reminds me of some old distro, was it free bsd? 

I lasted 2 days with it i sucsessfully compiled nushell by 
piggy-backing a system rustc package in the nix-shell
and doing a rustup, but it was not a compostable/ reproducable build 

and working with link stew is not my preference

then the flake system did not have link stew set up for the linker

I have burned through three Linux Distros in the last few months, Debian
Fedora and NixOS. I am back to Arch, old glove I guess.
